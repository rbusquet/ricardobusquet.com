## Day 1: Sonar Sweep

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1

For part 1, we're given a list of numbers and are asked how many times the numbers increase relatively to the previous number. The solution is pretty straightforward: loop over the list, compare each item with the previous, count the occurrence where it's greater than the previous:

```python
with open(Path(__file__).parent / "input.txt") as file:
    previous = int(file.readline())

    increases = 0
    for value in map(int, file):
        increases += value > previous
        previous = value
    return increases
```

For part 2, we're asked to consider the sum of a **three-measurement sliding window**. I thought I would need a `deque` to keep a list of 3 values, or use list comprehension + slices, when I remembered about [these recipes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes) in the python docs. I copied over an implementation for a generator of these windows and used for my solution:

```python
def sliding_window(iterable, n):
    # sliding_window('ABCDEFG', 4) -> ABCD BCDE CDEF DEFG
    it = iter(iterable)
    window = collections.deque(islice(it, n), maxlen=n)
    if len(window) == n:
        yield tuple(window)
    for x in it:
        window.append(x)
        yield tuple(window)

with open(Path(__file__).parent / "input.txt") as file:
    it = sliding_window(map(int, file), 3)
    previous = next(it)

    increases = 0
    for window in it:
        increases += sum(window) > sum(previous)
        previous = window
    return increases
```

For the next days, I'm adding [`more-itertools`](https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/) to have these recipes readily available!

## Day 2: Dive!

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2

Today, we're piloting a submarine, which has a planned course defined by a series of instructions (our input):

- `forward X` **increases** the horizontal position by `X` units.
- `down X` **increases** the depth by `X` units.
- `up X` **decreases** the depth by `X` units.

I think this looks neat with Python 3.10's structural pattern matching:

```python
horizontal = depth = 0
for command in file:
    match command.split(" "):
        case ["forward", distance]:
            horizontal += int(distance)
        case ["up", distance]:
            depth -= int(distance)
        case ["down", distance]:
            depth += int(distance)
return horizontal * depth
```

The puzzle claim that the result doesn't make sense, and when checking the submarine manual we notice the intructions track not only horizontal position and depth, but also **aim**, and the commands are also entirely different:

- `down X` **increases** your aim by `X` units.
- up X **decreases** your aim by `X` units.
- forward X does two things:
  - It **increases** your horizontal position by `X` units.
  - It **increases** your depth by your aim multiplied by `X`.

The solution looks a lot like part 1, but tracking the new `aim` variable:

```python
horizontal = depth = aim = 0
for command in file:
    match command.split(" "):
        case ["forward", distance]:
            horizontal += int(distance)
            depth += int(distance) * aim
        case ["up", distance]:
            aim -= int(distance)
        case ["down", distance]:
            aim += int(distance)
return horizontal * depth
```

The final solution for day 2 is in my [aoc repository](https://github.com/rbusquet/advent-of-code/blob/main/2021/02/day2.py)!

## Day 3: Binary Diagnostic

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2

On day 3, we're running diagnostics on the submarine. Our puzzle input is a list of binary number that can be decoded into information about the submarine.
For part 1, we're checking **power consumption** by calculating two values: the **game rate**, determined by finding the **most common bit in the corresponding position** of all numbers in our input; and the **epsilon rate**, calculated similarly, but by finding the **less common bit**.

My solution was a straighforward translation of the requirements into python code. I used `collection.Counter`s to count the bits for each position, retrieving the value using `Counter.most_common`.

```python
LENGTH = 12  # size of numbers in the report
report = [line.strip() for line in file]

def count(report: Iterable[str], position: int) -> Counter[str]:
    return Counter([value[position] for value in report])

counters: list[Counter[str]] = []
for position in range(LENGTH):  # O(LENGTH)
    counters.append(count(report, position))  # O(n)

gamma = [counter.most_common()[0][0] for counter in counters]
epsilon = [counter.most_common(2)[1][0] for counter in counters]
return list_of_bits_to_int(gamma) * list_of_bits_to_int(epsilon)
```

Next, we're checking the **life support rating**, again by calculating two numbers, the **oxygen generator rating** and the **CO2 scrubber rating**. To be honest, the description of how to locate these values will be much more clear [in the actual puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2) than I'd be able to summarize. Let me just show you the code:

```python
report = list(parse(file))

oxygen_report = co2_report = report  # keep a reference of the original reports
for position in range(LENGTH):
    counter = count(oxygen_report, position)  # count the bits at the posstion
    most_common, total = counter.most_common()[0]
    if len(oxygen_report) % 2 == 0 and total == len(oxygen_report) / 2:
        most_common = "1"  # tie breaker

    if len(oxygen_report) != 1:  # filter out the numbers in the report that matches the most common
        oxygen_report = [
            value for value in oxygen_report if value[position] == most_common
        ]
for position in range(LENGTH):
    # same deal as the above--but we're filtering out the numbers that match the less common bit
    counter = count(co2_report, position)
    most_common, total = counter.most_common()[0]
    if len(co2_report) % 2 == 0 and total == len(co2_report) / 2:
        most_common = "1"

    if len(co2_report) != 1:
        co2_report = [
            value for value in co2_report if value[position] != most_common
        ]

return list_of_bits_to_int(oxygen_report[0]) * list_of_bits_to_int(co2_report[0])
```

On day 3 I basically translated the requirements to python--I was surprised there weren't a lot of bitwise trickery to get to the solution. Now we wait for day 4. [Eric](http://was.tl/) likes to make us work on the weekends with these puzzles (See https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5, https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12...), so I'll be waiting for some fun work tomorrow.
