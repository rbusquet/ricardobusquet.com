## Day 1: Sonar Sweep

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1

For part 1, we're given a list of numbers and are asked how many times the numbers increase relatively to the previous number. The solution is pretty straightforward: loop over the list, compare each item with the previous, count the occurrence where it's greater than the previous:

```python
with open(Path(__file__).parent / "input.txt") as file:
    previous = int(file.readline())

    increases = 0
    for value in map(int, file):
        increases += value > previous
        previous = value
    return increases
```

For part 2, we're asked to consider the sum of a **three-measurement sliding window**. I thought I would need a `deque` to keep a list of 3 values, or use list comprehension + slices, when I remembered about [these recipes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes) in the python docs. I copied over an implementation for a generator of these windows and used for my solution:

```python
def sliding_window(iterable, n):
    # sliding_window('ABCDEFG', 4) -> ABCD BCDE CDEF DEFG
    it = iter(iterable)
    window = collections.deque(islice(it, n), maxlen=n)
    if len(window) == n:
        yield tuple(window)
    for x in it:
        window.append(x)
        yield tuple(window)

with open(Path(__file__).parent / "input.txt") as file:
    it = sliding_window(map(int, file), 3)
    previous = next(it)

    increases = 0
    for window in it:
        increases += sum(window) > sum(previous)
        previous = window
    return increases
```

For the next days, I'm adding [`more-itertools`](https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/) to have these recipes readily available!

## Day 2: Dive!

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2

Today, we're piloting a submarine, which has a planned course defined by a series of instructions (our input):

- `forward X` **increases** the horizontal position by `X` units.
- `down X` **increases** the depth by `X` units.
- `up X` **decreases** the depth by `X` units.

I think this looks neat with Python 3.10's structural pattern matching:

```python
horizontal = depth = 0
for command in file:
    match command.split(" "):
        case ["forward", distance]:
            horizontal += int(distance)
        case ["up", distance]:
            depth -= int(distance)
        case ["down", distance]:
            depth += int(distance)
return horizontal * depth
```

The puzzle claim that the result doesn't make sense, and when checking the submarine manual we notice the intructions track not only horizontal position and depth, but also **aim**, and the commands are also entirely different:

- `down X` **increases** your aim by `X` units.
- up X **decreases** your aim by `X` units.
- forward X does two things:
  - It **increases** your horizontal position by `X` units.
  - It **increases** your depth by your aim multiplied by `X`.

The solution looks a lot like part 1, but tracking the new `aim` variable:

```python
horizontal = depth = aim = 0
for command in file:
    match command.split(" "):
        case ["forward", distance]:
            horizontal += int(distance)
            depth += int(distance) * aim
        case ["up", distance]:
            aim -= int(distance)
        case ["down", distance]:
            aim += int(distance)
return horizontal * depth
```

The final solution for day 2 is in my [aoc repository](https://github.com/rbusquet/advent-of-code/blob/main/2021/02/day2.py)!
